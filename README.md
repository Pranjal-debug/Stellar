## Smart Contract Functions

* `initialize()`
* `create_campaign()`
* `get_campaign()`
* `get_campaigns()`
* `get_campaign_count()`
* `donate()`
* `close_campaign()`
* `withdraw()`
* `get_donation()`

---

## How It Works

### 1. Connect Wallet

The user connects a Stellar wallet to the application.

### 2. Create Campaign

A campaign creator provides:

* Title
* Description
* Funding Goal
* Deadline

The campaign is stored on the Soroban blockchain.

### 3. Donate

Users can donate Stellar assets to any active campaign.

Each successful donation:

* Transfers tokens to the smart contract
* Updates the campaign's total raised amount
* Refreshes the wallet balance
* Updates campaign progress

### 4. Close Campaign

Only the campaign creator can close an active campaign.

After closing:

* Donations are disabled.
* The campaign status changes to Closed.

### 5. Withdraw Funds

Once the campaign is closed, the creator can withdraw the collected funds.

Funds can only be withdrawn once.
